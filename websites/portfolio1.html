    <h2>Concepts and Definitions of Information Systems: Data, Information, and Knowledge</h2>
    <h3>What differentiates data, information, and knowledge?</h3>
    <p>
        Data refers to the raw facts and figures gathered. Information is obtained when data is processed into a meaningful and readable form. Knowledge is observed when the information is applied and used in the real world.
    </p>

    <h3>How does data transform into information and subsequently into knowledge?</h3>
    <p>
        Data is transformed into information when it is processed and organized so it is meaningful and understandable to other people (e.g. through a table, chart, etc.). It is transformed subsequently into knowledge when that information is synthesized and applied to make decisions or take action (e.g. using information of weather updates to determine what to wear for a week).
    </p>

    <h3>What are examples of data, information, and knowledge in real-world scenarios?</h3>
    <p>
        In a weather forecast scenario, data refers to raw measurements such as temperature readings, wind speed values, humidity percentages, and atmospheric pressure collected by sensors. When these numbers are processed and organized—such as stating that “today will be 32°C with light winds and a 60% chance of rain”—they become information because they now communicate meaning. Knowledge is gained when a person interprets this information to make a decision, such as bringing an umbrella because they understand that a 60% chance of rain strongly suggests it might rain later. 
    </p>

<div class="output fade-in">
    <h3>Describe a situation where data is collected and transformed into knowledge. Explain each transformation stage.</h3>
    <p>
The journey from raw data to actionable knowledge is fundamental to effective decision-making across all fields, particularly in healthcare. This transformation can be clearly observed in a hospital setting, specifically through the use of continuous patient monitoring systems, which follow a three-stage hierarchy to ensure patient safety and guide clinical intervention.

<br><br>In the initial stage, data refers to the raw, uninterpreted physiological measurements collected by medical sensors. These include continuous, high-frequency numerical streams such as heart rate in beats per minute (BPM), blood pressure readings, body temperature, and oxygen saturation percentages. In this raw form, these individual numbers lack immediate context; a heart rate reading of 115 BPM, for example, is merely a fact without meaning. The volume of this unstructured data requires systematic processing to become useful.

<br><br>The second stage involves the transformation of data into information. This occurs when the monitoring system aggregates, organizes, and processes the raw numbers against a patient’s established baseline and clinical norms. The system may calculate trends, flag deviations, and present the findings coherently—for instance, stating, “Patient X’s heart rate has increased from 80 BPM to 115 BPM over the last 30 minutes, concurrently with a drop in blood oxygen saturation to 90%.” This structured statement now communicates clear meaning regarding the patient’s status, moving beyond simple raw numbers.

<br><br>Finally, knowledge is generated when a trained medical professional, such as a nurse or doctor, interprets this information based on their training, experience, and understanding of the patient’s history. The clinician understands that a rapid, simultaneous change in heart rate and oxygen levels in a post-operative patient is not random, but may indicate an immediate, life-threatening event like a respiratory crisis or hemorrhage. This interpretation allows the professional to synthesize meaning and make a critical decision—in this case, immediately calling a rapid response team and initiating emergency protocols. In this way, data becomes life-saving knowledge through expert interpretation, driving timely and informed clinical action.

    <h3>Choose two areas within Computer Science (e.g., Artificial Intelligence, Cybersecurity) and discuss their importance and applications.</h3>
    <p>
The success of modern marketing relies entirely on digital presence, a realm where Computer Graphics and Visualization (CG&V) and Software Engineering (SE) form a symbiotic partnership. While CG&V focuses on what the user sees, SE dictates how quickly and reliably they see it, making both indispensable for a professional marketing team.

<br><br>Computer Graphics and Visualization is critical as it handles the creation and presentation of all visual assets. Its importance in marketing is found in graphic design, where it moves beyond simple aesthetics to drive brand recognition and customer engagement. CG&V principles guide the rendering of high-fidelity 3D product models, the dynamic layout of user interfaces, and the impactful use of color and motion in digital advertisements. For a marketing professional, CG&V transforms raw brand guidelines into a compelling visual narrative that directly influences purchasing decisions, effectively turning complex data into intuitive, persuasive communication.

<br><br>However, the most stunning visuals are worthless if they fail to load instantly or break down under user traffic. This is where the output of CG&V must transition into the disciplined domain of Software Engineering. SE is the systematic approach to designing, building, and maintaining reliable software systems. In the context of marketing, its importance is vital for the functional success of web design. SE ensures that websites and high-traffic campaign landing pages are not only aesthetically pleasing but are also secure, scalable, and optimized for speed across all devices.

<br><br>A marketing website developed using sound SE practices will have clean, efficient code that allows the graphic design assets to render quickly, minimizing lag and maximizing accessibility. This structural integrity, managed through engineering principles like modular design and rigorous testing, ensures the platform can handle sudden viral spikes in traffic without crashing, guaranteeing consistent customer interaction. Therefore, CG&V provides the knowledge (the visual context and aesthetic appeal) that Software Engineering packages into a robust, high-performing, and deliverable product, making them two essential pillars of digital marketing success.

    <h3>Select an industry (e.g., healthcare, finance) and explore the role of computer systems within it.</h3>
    <p>
Marketing-based businesses, such as grocery and retail stores, rely on swift, accurate transactions and informed decision-making to maintain profitability and a competitive edge. The operational backbone of these enterprises is a suite of integrated computer systems that transform every physical movement and financial exchange into valuable digital data, which is then refined into knowledge. At the heart of daily operations is the foundational Transaction Processing System (TPS), which reliably records sales at the Point-of-Sale (POS), updating inventory and financial records in real-time.

<br><br>Building upon this transactional data, the Customer Relationship Management (CRM) system manages the critical customer-facing side of the business. The importance of the CRM lies in its ability to track every interaction, often through loyalty programs and mobile apps. It analyzes individual purchase history, preference data, and response to previous promotions. This allows the marketing team to segment the customer base and execute highly personalized campaigns, such as sending a digital coupon for coffee specifically to customers who frequently buy pastries. By deepening customer loyalty and optimizing targeted marketing, the CRM directly affects daily revenue and repeat business, moving beyond simple sales recording to drive customer lifetime value.

<br><br>This front-end engagement must be balanced by highly efficient back-end operations, which are governed by the Supply Chain Management (SCM) system. For a grocery store handling perishable goods, the SCM is vital for profitability. It forecasts demand based on historical sales and seasonal trends, automatically triggering purchase orders to vendors. This complex system manages inventory flow from the distribution center to the store shelves, dramatically reducing waste from spoilage and preventing profit-killing stockouts. The SCM ensures that promotional items are delivered precisely when marketing campaigns start, aligning product availability with demand generated by the CRM.

<br><br>These two core systems (CRM and SCM) are complemented by other strategic tools. The Knowledge Management System (KMS) provides operational staff with documented best practices, while the Executive Information System (EIS) aggregates data from all sources to give senior management a high-level view of store performance, market share, and long-term trends. Together, this comprehensive ecosystem of computer systems ensures that every daily execution, from the checkout scan to the replenishment order, is optimized for both maximum efficiency and targeted customer appeal.
