    <h2>Basic Concepts of Computer Networks: Topology, Scope, Types, and Tools</h2>
    <h3>What are different network topologies, and where are they used?</h3>
    <p>
        Common network topologies include bus, star, ring, and mesh. A star topology is often used in homes and offices because each device connects to a central router, while mesh topologies are used in mission-critical systems due to their redundancy. Bus and ring topologies are simpler and used in smaller, controlled environments.
    </p>

    <h3>How do network types vary (e.g., LAN, WAN)?</h3>
    <p>
        Network types vary based on the geographical area they cover. A LAN (Local Area Network) connects devices within a small area like a home, school, or office, while a WAN (Wide Area Network) spans large areas such as regions or countries. MANs (Metropolitan Area Networks) cover city-sized areas, and PANs (Personal Area Networks) cover personal devices like phones and smartwatches.
    </p>

    <h3>What tools are commonly used in networking?</h3>
    <p>
        Common networking tools include routers, switches, modems, Ethernet cables, Wi-Fi adapters, and firewalls. These tools help transmit, direct, and secure data as it moves across devices. Without them, communication between computers would not be possible.

    <h3>Explain different network topologies (e.g., star, mesh) and their advantages.</h3>
    <p>
Network topologies refer to the physical or logical arrangements of devices and communication paths in a computer network. Understanding these structures is essential for designing systems that are efficient, scalable, reliable, and cost-effective. Among the most common topologies are bus, ring, mesh, star, tree, and hybrid, each offering unique advantages for different networking environments.
<br><br>The bus topology is one of the simplest forms, in which all devices connect to a single central cable or “bus.” Its main advantage is cost-efficiency: it requires minimal cabling and is easy to install, making it suitable for small networks or temporary setups. Troubleshooting is also straightforward because the topology is linear. However, the shared medium limits scalability and performance.
<br><br>In a ring topology, devices connect in a circular path, with data traveling in one direction (or both, in dual-ring systems). The structure provides predictable performance because each device has equal access to the network. Ring networks reduce data collisions and are efficient for networks with consistent traffic. They also offer better performance over long distances compared to bus layouts.
<br><br>A mesh topology provides the highest level of redundancy, as every device connects directly to multiple others. This creates multiple communication paths, ensuring that if one link fails, data can still travel through alternative routes. The main advantage is exceptional reliability and fault tolerance, making mesh topology ideal for critical systems such as telecommunications or large enterprise networks.
<br><br>The star topology connects each device to a central hub or switch. Its major advantages include easy installation, straightforward maintenance, and simple fault isolation—if one device fails, others remain unaffected. The central hub also helps manage network traffic efficiently.
<br><br>The tree topology is a hierarchical structure combining multiple star networks. It is highly scalable because new branches can be added with ease. This makes tree topology suitable for large organizations with departmental sub-networks that require structured growth.
<br><br>Finally, the hybrid topology merges multiple topologies—such as star-ring or star-mesh—allowing network designers to customize systems according to specific performance, reliability, and budget requirements. Its advantage lies in flexibility, enabling the strengths of different topologies to be combined into one robust network.

    <h2>Security, Ethics, and Privacy: IT Code of Ethics</h2>
    <h3>What are common ethical concerns in IT?</h3>
    <p>
        Common ethical concerns include data privacy, software piracy, hacking, plagiarism, and the misuse of digital resources. These issues can lead to financial loss, identity theft, and breaches of trust. The rise of digital technology has made these concerns more important than ever.
    </p>

    <h3>How do security and privacy considerations impact technology use?</h3>
    <p>
        Security and privacy concerns determine how safely individuals and organizations can use technology. When systems are not secure, users risk losing sensitive information or falling victim to cyberattacks. Strong security measures ensure trust, protect personal data, and support responsible technology use.
    </p>

    <h3>What is the purpose of the IT Code of Ethics?</h3>
    <p>
        The IT Code of Ethics guides IT professionals to act responsibly and ethically. It promotes values such as honesty, confidentiality, integrity, and respect for user rights. This helps create a safe and trustworthy digital environment for all.
    </p>

    <h3>Discuss an ethical issue in IT (e.g., data privacy) and how the IT Code of Ethics addresses it.</h3>
    <p>
Intellectual property (IP) has become increasingly important in the field of Information Technology, where digital content, software, and data can be copied, reused, or redistributed with ease. Among the most persistent ethical concerns is plagiarism, which involves presenting another person’s work—such as code, research, designs, or written content—as one’s own without proper acknowledgment. Unlike simple copying, plagiarism is an intentional act of intellectual dishonesty. In the IT field, plagiarism undermines both innovation and trust, which are foundational to technological progress and professional practice.
<br><br>In software development, for example, copying proprietary code without permission can lead to legal liabilities, security vulnerabilities, and loss of credibility. In academic and industry settings, plagiarized research devalues original work and compromises the integrity of knowledge production. Moreover, when IT professionals plagiarize, they fail to uphold the spirit of creativity and transparency that empowers technological advancement. Because IT relies heavily on collaborative work, open-source contributions, and continuous learning, plagiarism disrupts the ethical culture the industry strives to maintain.
<br><br>The IT Code of Ethics, such as those promoted by professional organizations like the Philippine Computer Society, ACM, and IEEE, provides clear guidelines addressing this issue. These codes emphasize honesty, respect for intellectual property, and proper attribution, all of which directly oppose plagiarism. For instance, core ethical principles require IT professionals to “acknowledge and respect the work of others,” “give credit where it is due,” and “avoid unauthorized copying of software, documentation, and digital content.” These provisions not only require professionals to cite sources but also to understand licensing agreements, adhere to copyright laws, and respect authorship rights.
<br><br>Additionally, the Code of Ethics encourages accountability and professional responsibility. By mandating that practitioners report unethical behavior, organizations create an environment where plagiarism is discouraged and integrity is rewarded. Ultimately, the IT Code of Ethics serves as both a preventive guide and a corrective mechanism, ensuring that IT professionals uphold intellectual honesty and preserve the integrity of the field as a whole.
