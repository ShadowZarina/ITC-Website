    <h2>Basic Concepts of Computer Networks: Topology, Scope, Types, and Tools</h2>
    <h3>What are different network topologies, and where are they used?</h3>
    <p>
        Common network topologies include **bus**, **star**, **ring**, and **mesh**. A **star topology** is often used in homes and offices because each device connects to a central router, while **mesh topologies** are used in mission-critical systems due to their redundancy. Bus and ring topologies are simpler and used in smaller, controlled environments.
    </p>

    <h3>How do network types vary (e.g., LAN, WAN)?</h3>
    <p>
        Network types vary based on the geographical area they cover. A **LAN** (Local Area Network) connects devices within a small area like a home, school, or office, while a **WAN** (Wide Area Network) spans large areas such as regions or countries. **MANs** (Metropolitan Area Networks) cover city-sized areas, and **PANs** (Personal Area Networks) cover personal devices like phones and smartwatches.
    </p>

    <h3>What tools are commonly used in networking?</h3>
    <p>
        Common networking tools include **routers**, **switches**, **modems**, **Ethernet cables**, **Wi-Fi adapters**, and **firewalls**. These tools help transmit, direct, and secure data as it moves across devices. Without them, communication between computers would not be possible.

    <h2>Security, Ethics, and Privacy: IT Code of Ethics</h2>
    <h3>What are common ethical concerns in IT?</h3>
    <p>
        Common ethical concerns include **data privacy**, **software piracy**, **hacking**, **plagiarism**, and the **misuse of digital resources**. These issues can lead to financial loss, identity theft, and breaches of trust. The rise of digital technology has made these concerns more important than ever.
    </p>

    <h3>How do security and privacy considerations impact technology use?</h3>
    <p>
        **Security and privacy concerns** determine how safely individuals and organizations can use technology. When systems are not secure, users risk losing sensitive information or falling victim to cyberattacks. Strong security measures ensure **trust**, protect personal data, and support responsible technology use.
    </p>

    <h3>What is the purpose of the IT Code of Ethics?</h3>
    <p>
        The **IT Code of Ethics** guides IT professionals to act responsibly and ethically. It promotes values such as **honesty**, **confidentiality**, **integrity**, and **respect for user rights**. This helps create a safe and trustworthy digital environment for all.
