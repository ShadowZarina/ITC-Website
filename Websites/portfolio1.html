    <h2>Concepts and Definitions of Information Systems: Data, Information, and Knowledge</h2>
    <h3>What differentiates data, information, and knowledge?</h3>
    <p>
        Data refers to the raw facts and figures gathered. Information is obtained when data is processed into a meaningful and readable form. Knowledge is observed when the information is applied and used in the real world.
    </p>

    <h3>How does data transform into information and subsequently into knowledge?</h3>
    <p>
        Data is transformed into information when it is processed and organized so it is meaningful and understandable to other people (e.g. through a table, chart, etc.). It is transformed subsequently into knowledge when that information is synthesized and applied to make decisions or take action (e.g. using information of weather updates to determine what to wear for a week).
    </p>

    <h3>What are examples of data, information, and knowledge in real-world scenarios?</h3>
    <p>
        In a weather forecast scenario, data refers to raw measurements such as temperature readings, wind speed values, humidity percentages, and atmospheric pressure collected by sensors. When these numbers are processed and organized—such as stating that “today will be 32°C with light winds and a 60% chance of rain”—they become information because they now communicate meaning. Knowledge is gained when a person interprets this information to make a decision, such as bringing an umbrella because they understand that a 60% chance of rain strongly suggests it might rain later.

<div class="question">
    <h2>Areas of the Computer Science Discipline</h2>
    <h3>What are the main areas of Computer Science?</h3>
    <p>
        The main areas of Computer Science include Programming, AI and Machine Learning, Computer Graphics and Visualization, Computer Networking, Cybersecurity, Databases and Information Systems, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Software Engineering, Data Analytics, and Hardware and Technical Support.
    </p>

    <h3>How do these areas contribute to technology and society?</h3>
    <p>
        Each area contributes significantly to society by solving specific types of problems and improving technological progress. For example, AI enables automation and smarter decision-making, while cybersecurity protects individuals and businesses from digital threats. Database Systems allow large-scale data storage, and networks enable global communication, making daily tasks faster, safer, and more efficient.
    </p>

    <h3>What skills or knowledge are unique to each area?</h3>
    <p>
        Each major area of Computer Science develops a distinct set of skills and knowledge. Programming focuses on writing efficient code and understanding algorithms, while AI and Machine Learning require knowledge of data patterns, model training, and mathematical foundations. Computer Graphics, Networking, Cybersecurity, Databases, HCI, Software Engineering, Data Analytics, and Hardware Support each demand specialized abilities such as visual rendering techniques, communication protocols, threat prevention, data modeling, user-centered design, large-scale software planning, statistical analysis, and troubleshooting physical components.

    <h2>Various Uses of Computer Systems in the Modern World</h2>
    <h3>What are the main uses of computer systems in different industries?</h3>
    <p>
        Computer systems are widely used in industries such as healthcare, education, business, engineering, and entertainment. They are used in the form of Transaction Processing Systems (TPS), Knowledge Management Systems (KMS), Executive Information Systems (EIS), and the like. In healthcare, they support patient records, diagnostics, and medical imaging; in education, they enable online learning and digital assessment. Businesses depend on computers for accounting, sales, inventory management, and data analysis, making operations more efficient.
    </p>

    <h3>How have computers revolutionized work and daily life?</h3>
    <p>
        Computers have dramatically changed how people work by enabling remote work, real-time communication, and fast data processing. Daily life has also transformed through online banking, e-commerce, entertainment platforms, and social media. These changes have made tasks more convenient and connected people across long distances.
    </p>

    <h3>What are the potential future uses of computers in emerging fields?</h3>
    <p>
       Future uses of computers will likely involve quantum computing, autonomous vehicles, advanced robotics, and personalized AI assistants. Computers will also play a major role in biotechnology, climate simulation, and smart city development. These advancements could make society more efficient and allow machines to do complex tasks that currently require human intelligence.
