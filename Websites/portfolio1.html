    <h2>Concepts and Definitions of Information Systems: Data, Information, and Knowledge</h2>
    <h3>What differentiates data, information, and knowledge?</h3>
    <p>
        Data refers to the raw facts and figures gathered. Information is obtained when data is processed into a meaningful and readable form. Knowledge is observed when the information is applied and used in the real world.
    </p>

    <h3>How does data transform into information and subsequently into knowledge?</h3>
    <p>
        Data is transformed into information when it is processed and organized so it is meaningful and understandable to other people (e.g. through a table, chart, etc.). It is transformed subsequently into knowledge when that information is synthesized and applied to make decisions or take action (e.g. using information of weather updates to determine what to wear for a week).
    </p>

    <h3>What are examples of data, information, and knowledge in real-world scenarios?</h3>
    <p>
        In a weather forecast scenario, data refers to raw measurements such as temperature readings, wind speed values, humidity percentages, and atmospheric pressure collected by sensors. When these numbers are processed and organized—such as stating that “today will be 32°C with light winds and a 60% chance of rain”—they become information because they now communicate meaning. Knowledge is gained when a person interprets this information to make a decision, such as bringing an umbrella because they understand that a 60% chance of rain strongly suggests it might rain later.
