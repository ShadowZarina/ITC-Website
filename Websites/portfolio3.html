    <h2>Computer Hardware Concepts: IPOS Devices, Internal and External Parts</h2>
    <h3>What are the main components involved in the Input-Process-Output-Storage (IPOS) cycle?</h3>
    <p>
        The **IPOS cycle** includes **input devices**, **processors**, **output devices**, and **storage units**. Input devices like keyboards and mice bring data into the system, while the **CPU** (processing component) processes that data. The processed information is displayed using output devices like monitors, and storage devices like **SSDs** and **HDDs** save the data for long-term use.
    </p>

    <h3>How do internal and external hardware components support computing?</h3>
    <p>
        **Internal components** like the **CPU**, **RAM**, and **motherboard** work together to execute instructions and manage the system. **External components** such as printers, speakers, scanners, and monitors allow users to interact with the computer more effectively. Together, internal and external parts ensure the system functions smoothly and serves user needs.
    </p>

    <h3>What are the functions of each component?</h3>
    <p>
        Each hardware component plays a unique role in computer operations. The **CPU** performs calculations and logic, **RAM** temporarily stores data for quick access, and **storage devices** keep files permanently. **Input devices** capture user data, and **output devices** present processed information back to the user.
    </p>

    <h2>Software Application Types: Utilities</h2>
    <h3>What are utility software types and their purposes?</h3>
    <p>
        **Utility software** includes programs designed to **maintain**, **optimize**, and **protect** the computer system. These types include **antivirus programs**, **backup and maintenance software**, **file compression tools**, and **productivity apps**. Their purposes range from removing malware and cleaning unnecessary files to organizing data and improving system performance and allowing users to organize work and promote efficient collaboration. These tools help keep the computer efficient and secure.
    </p>

    <h3>How does each utility software contribute to system maintenance and security?</h3>
    <p>
        **Antivirus programs** prevent infections by scanning for malicious files, while **backup and maintenance software** protects data by creating copies of important documents and maintaining a good state of hardware and software. **File compression tools** reduce the size of files to save space and make sharing easier, while **productivity apps** enhance efficiency and collaboration for users. Together, they ensure the system remains safe, fast, and stable.
    </p>

    <h3>What are examples of antivirus, backup, file compression, and productivity apps?</h3>
    <p>
        Examples of **antivirus applications** include Avast and McAfee, while **backup and maintenance tools** include Google Drive and Dropbox. **File compression programs** include WinRAR and 7-Zip. **Productivity-related apps** include Google Workspace, Microsoft Office Suite, and Trello.

<div class="question">
    <h2>Basic Concepts and Definitions of Data and Database</h2>
    <h3>What is the purpose of a database, and how is it structured?</h3>
    <p>
        A **database** stores large amounts of data in an **organized manner** so users can retrieve, update, and manage information efficiently. It is structured into **tables** composed of **rows and columns**, making the data easy to search and manipulate. This structure allows fast access and ensures consistency in data handling.
    </p>

    <h3>How does data storage differ between traditional files and databases?</h3>
    <p>
        **Traditional file storage** keeps data in separate documents, which can lead to duplication, inconsistencies, and difficulty in searching. **Databases**, however, **centralize information** in structured tables and allow multiple users to access the data simultaneously. This makes databases more efficient, accurate, and scalable.
    </p>

    <h3>What are the advantages of using databases?</h3>
    <p>
        Databases offer improved **data security**, reduced **redundancy**, and **faster retrieval** of information. They support large-scale storage and allow multiple users to access data without conflict. Databases also include features like backup, encryption, and validation, making them more reliable than traditional file systems.
