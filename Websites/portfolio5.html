    <h2>HTML Programming</h2>
    <h3>What is the structure of an HTML document?</h3>
    <p>
        An HTML document begins with the **DOCTYPE** declaration, followed by the **&lt;html&gt;** tag that contains the entire page. Inside it, the **&lt;head&gt;** section holds metadata and the **&lt;title&gt;**, while the **&lt;body&gt;** section contains all the visible content. This structure ensures that browsers understand how to display the webpage correctly.
    </p>

    <h3>How are HTML tags used to structure content on a webpage?</h3>
    <p>
        HTML tags define different parts of a webpage such as **headings**, **paragraphs**, **images**, **links**, and **tables**. Each tag has a specific purpose and helps organize content so it is readable and structured. These tags guide the browser on how to display each section of the webpage.
    </p>

    <h3>What are common HTML tags?</h3>
    <p>
        Common HTML tags include **&lt;h1&gt;** for headings, **&lt;p&gt;** for paragraphs, **&lt;a&gt;** for links, and **&lt;img&gt;** for images. Other important tags include **&lt;div&gt;** for layout, **&lt;ul&gt;** and **&lt;li&gt;** for lists, and **&lt;table&gt;** for tabular data. These tags create the foundation of most web pages.

<div class="question">
    <h2>CSS Programming</h2>
    <h3>How does CSS enhance HTML?</h3>
    <p>
        **CSS** enhances HTML by adding styling such as **colors**, **spacing**, **fonts**, **borders**, and **layouts**. Without CSS, web pages would appear plain and unformatted. With CSS, developers can create visually appealing and user-friendly designs.
    </p>

    <h3>What are the main components of CSS syntax?</h3>
    <p>
        CSS syntax consists of a **selector**, **properties**, and **values**. The **selector** chooses the HTML element, the **property** defines what to change (like color or font size), and the **value** tells how to apply that change. Together, these components allow precise control over webpage appearance.
    </p>

    <h3>How can CSS be applied to improve the look and feel of web pages?</h3>
    <p>
        CSS can be applied **inline**, inside the HTML document, or through an **external stylesheet**. It improves the look and feel by controlling **layout**, **aligning elements**, and creating **consistent styles** across multiple pages. CSS also supports animations, responsive design, and customized themes.

    <h2>Future of Computing: Generative AI and Data Analytics</h2>
    <h3>What is Generative AI, and how does it differ from traditional AI?</h3>
    <p>
        **Generative AI** creates **new content** such as text, images, and music, while **traditional AI** mainly **analyzes data** and makes predictions. This makes generative AI more creative and capable of producing original outputs. Traditional AI focuses on classification and decision-making, while generative AI expands into creativity.
    </p>

    <h3>How are data analytics transforming industries?</h3>
    <p>
        **Data analytics** helps industries make **smarter decisions** by analyzing large datasets to uncover **patterns and trends**. It is used in finance for fraud detection, in healthcare for diagnosis, and in business for predicting customer behavior. These insights lead to better strategies, reduced costs, and improved services.
    </p>

    <h3>What ethical considerations are associated with AI?</h3>
    <p>
        AI raises concerns about **data privacy**, **misinformation**, **job displacement**, and **biases in algorithms**. These issues require responsible development and regulation to prevent harm. Ethical AI ensures **fairness**, **transparency**, and **accountability**.
