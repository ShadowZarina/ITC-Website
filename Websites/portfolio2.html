    <h2>Algorithm, Pseudocode, and Flowcharting</h2>
    <h3>What is the purpose of algorithms in problem-solving?</h3>
    <p>
        Algorithms provide a systematic, step-by-step method for solving problems, ensuring accuracy and efficiency. By breaking down a problem into smaller, manageable parts, algorithms help programmers design clearer and more reliable solutions. They serve as the foundation of all computer programs and automate logical processes.
    </p>

    <h3>How do pseudocode and flowcharts aid in programming?</h3>
    <p>
        Pseudocode uses plain language to outline the logic of a program, making it easier for programmers to plan before coding. Flowcharts, on the other hand, visually map the sequence of operations using symbols and arrows. Both tools help programmers understand the logic, detect errors early, and communicate ideas more effectively.
    </p>

    <h3>What are the differences between pseudocode and flowcharts?</h3>
    <p>
        Pseudocode is written in text form and resembles simplified programming language, while flowcharts are visual and use shapes to represent steps. Flowcharts are easier to understand at a glance, especially for visual learners, while pseudocode is easier to modify. Both accomplish the same purpose, but they differ in format and presentation.

    <h2>Areas of the Computer Science Discipline</h2>
    <h3>What are the main areas of Computer Science?</h3>
    <p>
        The main areas of Computer Science include Programming, AI and Machine Learning, Computer Graphics and Visualization, Computer Networking, Cybersecurity, Databases and Information Systems, Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), Software Engineering, Data Analytics, and Hardware and Technical Support.
    </p>

    <h3>How do these areas contribute to technology and society?</h3>
    <p>
        Each area contributes significantly to society by solving specific types of problems and improving technological progress. For example, AI enables automation and smarter decision-making, while cybersecurity protects individuals and businesses from digital threats. Database Systems allow large-scale data storage, and networks enable global communication, making daily tasks faster, safer, and more efficient.
    </p>

    <h3>What skills or knowledge are unique to each area?</h3>
    <p>
        Each major area of Computer Science develops a distinct set of skills and knowledge. Programming focuses on writing efficient code and understanding algorithms, while AI and Machine Learning require knowledge of data patterns, model training, and mathematical foundations. Computer Graphics, Networking, Cybersecurity, Databases, HCI, Software Engineering, Data Analytics, and Hardware Support each demand specialized abilities such as visual rendering techniques, communication protocols, threat prevention, data modeling, user-centered design, large-scale software planning, statistical analysis, and troubleshooting physical components.

    <h2>Various Uses of Computer Systems in the Modern World</h2>
    <h3>What are the main uses of computer systems in different industries?</h3>
    <p>
        Computer systems are widely used in industries such as healthcare, education, business, engineering, and entertainment. They are used in the form of Transaction Processing Systems (TPS), Knowledge Management Systems (KMS), Executive Information Systems (EIS), and the like. In healthcare, they support patient records, diagnostics, and medical imaging; in education, they enable online learning and digital assessment. Businesses depend on computers for accounting, sales, inventory management, and data analysis, making operations more efficient.
    </p>

    <h3>How have computers revolutionized work and daily life?</h3>
    <p>
        Computers have dramatically changed how people work by enabling remote work, real-time communication, and fast data processing. Daily life has also transformed through online banking, e-commerce, entertainment platforms, and social media. These changes have made tasks more convenient and connected people across long distances.
    </p>

    <h3>What are the potential future uses of computers in emerging fields?</h3>
    <p>
       Future uses of computers will likely involve quantum computing, autonomous vehicles, advanced robotics, and personalized AI assistants. Computers will also play a major role in biotechnology, climate simulation, and smart city development. These advancements could make society more efficient and allow machines to do complex tasks that currently require human intelligence.
