    <h2>Algorithm, Pseudocode, and Flowcharting</h2>
    <h3>What is the purpose of algorithms in problem-solving?</h3>
    <p>
        Algorithms provide a systematic, step-by-step method for solving problems, ensuring accuracy and efficiency. By breaking down a problem into smaller, manageable parts, algorithms help programmers design clearer and more reliable solutions. They serve as the foundation of all computer programs and automate logical processes.
    </p>

    <h3>How do pseudocode and flowcharts aid in programming?</h3>
    <p>
        Pseudocode uses plain language to outline the logic of a program, making it easier for programmers to plan before coding. Flowcharts, on the other hand, visually map the sequence of operations using symbols and arrows. Both tools help programmers understand the logic, detect errors early, and communicate ideas more effectively.
    </p>

    <h3>What are the differences between pseudocode and flowcharts?</h3>
    <p>
        Pseudocode is written in text form and resembles simplified programming language, while flowcharts are visual and use shapes to represent steps. Flowcharts are easier to understand at a glance, especially for visual learners, while pseudocode is easier to modify. Both accomplish the same purpose, but they differ in format and presentation.

    <h2>Concept of Number Systems</h2>
    <h3>What are the common number systems used in computing?</h3>
    <p> The most common number systems in computing include decimal (base 10), binary (base 2), octal (base 8), and hexadecimal (base 16). Binary is used by computers internally, while octal and hexadecimal provide shorter representations of long binary values. Each system has a specific use and helps simplify computer operations and programming tasks. </p>
    
    <h3>How do conversions between binary, decimal, and hexadecimal work?</h3>
    <p> Conversions work by applying place values based on the base of the number system. For example, converting binary to decimal involves multiplying each digit by powers of 2, while converting decimal to binary involves repeated division by 2. Hexadecimal often converts easily to binary by replacing each digit with its 4-bit binary equivalent. </p>
    
    <h3>Why is the binary system essential for computers?</h3>
    <p> The binary system is essential because computers operate using electrical signals that can only represent two states: ON and OFF. These states correspond perfectly to the digits 1 and 0 in binary. As a result, binary becomes the most efficient and reliable system for machine-level communication. </p>

    <h2>Software and Application Concepts: General and Specific Purpose Software</h2>
    <h3>What is the difference between general-purpose and specific-purpose software?</h3>
    <p> General-purpose software is designed to perform a wide variety of tasks, such as creating documents, browsing the internet, or editing images. Specific-purpose software is created for a single or specialized function, like monitoring hospital patients or managing a payroll system. The main difference lies in flexibility—general-purpose software is versatile, while specific-purpose software is specialized. </p>
    
    <h3>How do they cater to different user needs?</h3>
    <p> General-purpose software caters to everyday users who need tools for writing, spreadsheets, communication, or media editing. Specific-purpose software caters to industries or organizations that require unique tools to perform highly specialized tasks efficiently. By serving different needs, both types of software help individuals and businesses accomplish goals effectively. </p>
    
    <h3>What are examples of each type?</h3>
    <p> Examples of general-purpose software include Microsoft Word, Google Chrome, and Adobe Photoshop. Examples of specific-purpose software include ATM software, school grading systems, hospital management systems, and POS (Point of Sale) systems. These examples show the variety of tasks software can help accomplish. </p>
